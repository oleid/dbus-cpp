dbus-cpp (1.0.0+14.04.20140123.1-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=medium

  [ Thomas Voß ]
  * Force compilation against GCC 4.7. Account for toolchain differences.

  [ Łukasz 'sil2100' Zemczak ]
  * Drop symbols file as a last minute decision. The ABI is not stable and
    different between architectures. This change won't be merged in trunk.
    shlibs -V is used in the meantime.

  [ Thomas Voß ]
  * Manual version bump.

  [ Ubuntu daily release ]
  * debian/*symbols: auto-update new symbols to released version

  [ thomas-voss ]
  * Update fork_and_run method ensuring that the test process does not
    get corrupted. Fix emission of signals carrying values. Remove
    duplicate setup of message handler for get and set on property.
  * Fix property handling. Fix pkgconfig setup to make sure that clients
    of the library correctly link to it.
  * Add fixture for testing purposes.
  * Fix map decoding.
  * Make sure that the map is cleared initially.
  * Make sure that expectations not being met fails cross-process test
    cases. Add a class SigTermCatcher to ease cross-process testing.
  * Add operator!= for types::ObjectPath.
  * Fix signal creation to always return unique instances. Add test case
    to prevent from regressions.
  * Clean up patch and augment test case. Refactor Variant to rely on an
    encoder and decoder functor.
  * Switch type for ArgumentType::byte to std::uint8_t as per DBus spec.
    (LP: #1270843)
  * Add test-cases for same object, same interface, different & same
    member signals.
  * Add sender to match rule for event filtering.
  * Add a thread-safe lifetime constrained object cache & accompanying
    tests.
  * Fix paths to default system and session bus config files.

  [ Antti Kaijanmäki ]
  * Add Object::path() to get the ObjectPath for an Object.
  * Fix signal creation to always return unique instances. Add test case
    to prevent from regressions.

  [ Łukasz 'sil2100' Zemczak ]
  * Merge all symbols file into one file with arch-conditional symbols
    in it. It should be good this way.
